### ♥ **What is Data-Structure**

➔ A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. <br/>
➔ It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. <br/>
➔ It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. <br/>

📃 Example - In fridge, the vegetales,food,fruits (datas) can be __STORE__ , __ORGANIZE__ , __ACCESS__ , __MANIPULATE__ <br/>

*here TREE and GRAPHS are NON-LINEAR DATASTRUCTURE*

➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖

### 1️⃣ Linear data structure
➔ Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly <br/>
➔ where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements <br/>
➔ Data items can be traversed in a single run <br/>
➔ Implementation is easy. <br/>
➔ EX- Array, Stacks, linked list, queue <br/>

✔️ __Static data structure__ <br/>
➔ Static data structure has a fixed memory size <br/>
➔ Compile time memory allocation <br/>
➔ easier to access the elements <br/>
➔ EX- Array <br/>

✔️ __Dynamic data structure__ <br/>
➔ the size is not fixed <br/>
➔ randomly updated during the runtime <br/>
➔ which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code <br/>
➔ EX- Stacks, linked list, queue <br/>

### 2️⃣ Non-linear data structure
➔ Every item is attached with many other items. <br/>
➔ Data is not arranged in sequence. <br/>
➔ Data cannot be traversed in a single run. <br/>
➔ Implementation is difficult. <br/>
➔ EX- tree, graph.
