### ‚ô• **What is Data-Structure**

‚ûî A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. <br/>
‚ûî It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. <br/>
‚ûî It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. <br/>

üìÉ Example - In fridge, the vegetales,food,fruits (datas) can be __STORE__ , __ORGANIZE__ , __ACCESS__ , __MANIPULATE__ <br/>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear data structure
‚ûî Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly <br/>
‚ûî where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements <br/>
‚ûî Data items can be traversed in a single run <br/>
‚ûî Implementation is easy. <br/>
‚ûî EX- Array, Stacks, linked list, queue <br/>

‚úîÔ∏è __Static data structure__ <br/>
‚ûî Static data structure has a fixed memory size <br/>
‚ûî Compile time memory allocation <br/>
‚ûî easier to access the elements <br/>
‚ûî EX- Array <br/>

‚úîÔ∏è __Dynamic data structure__ <br/>
‚ûî the size is not fixed <br/>
‚ûî randomly updated during the runtime <br/>
‚ûî which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code <br/>
‚ûî EX- Stacks, linked list, queue <br/>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Non-linear data structure
‚ûî Every item is attached with many other items. <br/>
‚ûî Data is not arranged in sequence. <br/>
‚ûî Data cannot be traversed in a single run. <br/>
‚ûî Implementation is difficult. <br/>
‚ûî EX- tree, graph. <br/>

### üíô STRUCTURE
‚ûî allow us to combine the data of different types <br/>
‚ûî use to create complex datatype which contains different dataTypes <br/>
‚ûî similar to array but in array we can store only one dataType but in struct we can store multiple dataTypes <br/>
‚ûî user defined dataType <br/>

üìÉ Example - if we want to store the inforamtion of 1000 employee of XYZ company and the information is like NAME, ADDRESS, EMAIL, EMPLOYEE_ID ==> then we can create the STRUCT one time with different dataTypes like `char name` , `char address[]` , `int email` , `float employee_id` to store the info of every employee 

```

struct structure_name   
{  
    data_type member1;  
    data_type member2;  
    .  
    .  
    data_type memeber;  
};

```
‚ûî the memory allocation for struct cannot create Until we decalre the struct <br/>
‚ûî when we declare the struct all the memory allocate bcz of user defined datatype <br/>

```

// declaring struct here 
struct structure_name x;

// access the element of struct using structure-member-operator (.)
x.member1 = value;
x.member2 = value;

```

### üíö UNION
‚ûî very similar to Struct ( user defined dataType)
‚ûî difference between Struct and Union is that -> in struct each element has its own storage memory allocation but in union there is only single shared memory location which is **equal to the size of largest data member** means the dataType in union which needed the highest bytes means MAX SIZE will become the single shared memory location

üìÉ Example - **why we need the Union=** i have to play the drums in different time in morning, in afternoon, in night AND in morning i need 2 sticks to play drum AND in afternoon i need 3 sticks to play drum AND in night i need 2 sticks to play drum ==> so if i go to market then i take only 3 sticks not the 2+3+2=6 sticks because AT A TIME ONLY ONE DRUM IS PLAYING (so at a time we are using only one element from struct that time make union) ‚ûî Union cannot handle all members at once

```

union union_name   
{  
    data_type member1;  
    data_type member2;  
    .  
    .  
    data_type memeber;  
};  

```
‚ûî the memory allocation for union cannot create Until we decalre the union <br/>
‚ûî when we declare the union all the memory allocate bcz of user defined datatype <br/>

```

// declaring struct here 
union union_name x , y ;

// access the element of struct using structure-member-operator (.)
x.member1 = value; // at a time we can use only one member
y.member2 = value; // at a time we can use only one member

// if we try to acces more than one member then the first assigned member's value will be currept and the second assigned member's value will be become original

```

### üíõ SELF REFRENTIAL STRUCTURE
‚ûî one structure which have pointer as member and which point to the same type of structure <br/>

### üíô POINTER
‚ûî variable that contains the address of another variable. it is a variable that points to any other variable <br/>
‚ûî Pointers are used to dynamically allocate or deallocate memory using methods such as malloc(), realloc(), calloc(), and free(). <br/>
‚ûî size depends on architechure ex. 2 byte for 32 bit <br/>

```

int myAge = 43 ;
int* ptr = &myAge ; // here ptr is pointer and we are storing the address of myAge variable in ptr pointer

printf("%d\n", myAge) ; // value of myAge (43)
printf("%p\n", &myAge) ; // memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044)
printf("%p\n", ptr) ; // memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)
printf("%d\n", *ptr) ; // using pointer the value of myAge (43)

```
